What am I Eating?
=================

"What Am I Eating?" is the new app dedicated to helping you understand what you're really putting into your body.

"What Am I Eating?" helps you to understand what food labels actually mean. Using the FoodEssentials API provided by Mashery, "What Am I Eating?" allows you to scan a barcode, then instantly have access to data about the product such as Additives and Nutrition Facts. If you aren't sure what a specific ingredient is, you can simply tap on the item to bring up more information about it. 



This app was made at HackRU, a 24 hour programming meetup hosted at Rutgers University:
